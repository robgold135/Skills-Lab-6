Our program is a program that asks and labels people's name and their ages. The program also detects if the name or age is available. When typing the answer make sure the name should be all letters and age should be all numbers, otherwise, the program will now run and show an error. The way to access our code is to click our GitHub link and then click "fork" in the "code" section. After that you can change can contribute to our code, if you have any interesting ideas on changing the code please request and we will take look and think about it.
